## 📋 Next Steps - Complete Day 1

### Step 1: Install Python Dependencies (30 minutes)

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project directory
cd ~/devops-copilot-ml

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade pip

# Install all dependencies (this will take 10-15 minutes)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Verify key installations
python -c "import numpy; print(f'✅ NumPy: {numpy.__version__}')"
python -c "import pandas; print(f'✅ Pandas: {pandas.__version__}')"
python -c "import sklearn; print(f'✅ Scikit-learn: {sklearn.__version__}')"
python -c "import langchain; print(f'✅ LangChain: {langchain.__version__}')"
python -c "import kubernetes; print(f'✅ Kubernetes: {kubernetes.__version__}')"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ NumPy: 1.26.3
✅ Pandas: 2.1.4
✅ Scikit-learn: 1.4.0
✅ LangChain: 0.1.0
✅ Kubernetes: 29.0.0
```

### Step 2: Install Ollama & Download LLM (20 minutes)

```bash
# Install Ollama (if not already installed)
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh

# Verify installation
ollama --version

# Download Llama 3.1 8B model (~4.7GB, takes 10-15 minutes)
ollama pull llama3.1:8b

# Test the model
ollama run llama3.1:8b "Explain what DevOps is in one sentence"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) 
and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the development lifecycle and deliver 
high-quality software continuously.
```

**To exit Ollama chat:** Type `/bye` or press `Ctrl+D`

---

### Step 3: Verify Kubernetes Access (5 minutes)

```bash
# Configure kubectl for EKS
aws eks --region us-east-1 update-kubeconfig --name a208234-preprod-confirm-ot-useast1-plexus-cluster

# Verify you can access the cluster
kubectl get nodes

# Check QA namespace
kubectl get pods -n 207804-confirmation-qa

# Try to get logs from a pod (replace <pod-name> with actual pod)
kubectl logs -n 207804-confirmation-qa <pod-name> --tail=10
```

---

### Step 4: Commit Your Work to GitHub

```bash
# Check status
git status

# Add all files (venv is excluded by .gitignore)
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Initial project setup: structure, dependencies, and documentation"

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## 📚 Learning Materials for Today

Now that setup is complete, dedicate 4-5 hours to learning:

### 1. Watch Videos (2.5 hours)
- [ ] 3Blue1Brown - Neural Networks (3 videos, ~1 hour)
- [ ] Andrej Karpathy - Intro to LLMs (~1 hour)
- [ ] StatQuest - ML Basics (optional, 30 min)

### 2. Read (1.5 hours)
- [ ] "Hands-On Machine Learning" Chapter 1
- [ ] "Hands-On Machine Learning" Chapter 2

### 3. Practice (1 hour)
- [ ] Create and run `notebooks/00_ml_basics.ipynb`
- [ ] Experiment with the code examples

**See `docs/DAY1_LEARNING_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions!**

## 🎯 Success Criteria for Day 1

You've completed Day 1 when you can answer YES to all:

- [ ] ✅ Project structure created
- [ ] ✅ Git repository initialized and pushed to GitHub
- [ ] ✅ Virtual environment created
- [ ] ✅ All Python dependencies installed
- [ ] ✅ Ollama installed and Llama 3.1 downloaded

## 🚀 Tomorrow's Preview (Day 2)

Tomorrow you'll build your first real component - the Kubernetes Log Collector!

**What you'll build:**
- Python script to collect logs from K8s pods
- DuckDB database for log storage
- Log parsing and categorization logic
- Data exploration notebook

**What you'll learn:**
- Kubernetes Python client
- DuckDB for analytics
- Log parsing techniques
- Data exploration with pandas

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Installation Issues:

**If pip install fails:**
```bash
# Try installing in smaller batches
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
pip install langchain langchain-community chromadb
pip install fastapi uvicorn streamlit
pip install kubernetes boto3
```

**If Ollama download is slow:**
- The model is 4.7GB, so it takes time
- You can continue with other tasks while it downloads
- Alternative: Use `mistral:7b` (smaller, faster)

**If Kubernetes access fails:**
```bash
# Check AWS credentials
aws sts get-caller-identity

# Verify kubectl config
kubectl config current-context

# Check if you have the right permissions
kubectl auth can-i get pods -n 207804-confirmation-qa
```

## 📊 Time Tracking

Track your time to stay on schedule:

```markdown
Day 1 Time Log:
- Setup (structure, git, files): ___ hours
- Installing dependencies: ___ hours
- Installing Ollama: ___ hours
- Learning (videos, reading): ___ hours
- Practice (notebooks): ___ hours
- Total: ___ hours

Target: 6-8 hours total for Day 1
```

## 🆘 Need Help?

### Common Issues:

1. **"Module not found" errors**
   - Make sure virtual environment is activated
   - Run `pip list` to verify installations

2. **Ollama not found**
   - Restart terminal after installation
   - Check: `which ollama`

3. **Kubernetes access denied**
   - Verify AWS credentials
   - Check IAM permissions
   - Ensure VPN is connected (if required)

4. **Out of disk space**
   - Llama 3.1 needs ~5GB
   - Check: `df -h`
