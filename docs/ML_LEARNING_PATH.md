### **For RAG System:**
1. **Embeddings**: Logs as vectors in high-dimensional space
2. **Similarity**: Similar logs are close in vector space
3. **Context Window**: How much text can LLM handle?
4. **Prompt Engineering**: How to ask the LLM effectively

### **Math You Need:**
1. **Vectors**: Data points in space
2. **Dot Product**: Measure similarity
