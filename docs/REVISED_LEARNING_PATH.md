## üéØ Key Principles for Success

### **1. Build Foundation First**
- Don't skip fundamentals
- Understand simple models before complex ones
- Math intuition before formulas
- Concepts before code

### **2. Learn by Doing**
- Watch video ‚Üí Read ‚Üí Code ‚Üí Experiment
- Break things and fix them
- Modify examples
- Build projects

### **3. Connect to Your Work**
- Think about DevOps applications
- Solve real problems
- Make it relevant
- Build portfolio projects

### **4. Be Patient**
- ML is complex - it takes time
- Some concepts need multiple exposures
- It's OK to not understand everything immediately
- Come back to difficult topics

### **5. Practice Consistently**
- Daily learning is better than cramming
- 2-3 hours per day is ideal
- Take breaks
- Review regularly
